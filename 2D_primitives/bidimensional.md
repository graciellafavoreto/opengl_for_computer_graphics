## Colored Triangle (OpenGL in Python)

The file `triangle_basic.py` demonstrates how to render a 2D triangle with interpolated vertex colors using **OpenGL** in **Python**.  
This example illustrates the fundamentals of creating 2D primitives, defining vertices, and applying real-time color interpolation through the OpenGL graphics pipeline.

When the script is executed, a window opens displaying the rendered colored triangle.  
The result was exihibited in `colored_triangle_output.png` in the project root directory.
